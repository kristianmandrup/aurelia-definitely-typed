# Aurelia Definitely Typed definition files

This repo contains [DefinitelyTyped](http://definitelytyped.org/) definition files for [Aurelia](aurelia.io).

## Goals

To get all these `d.ts` files hosted on [DefinitelyTyped](http://definitelytyped.org/) and the [repo](https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped)

This will allow us to use the [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) [tsd](http://definitelytyped.org/tsd/) package manager for Aurelia libs.

## Contributing

This repo has been shaped according to the [DefinitelyTyped contribution guidelines](http://definitelytyped.org/guides/contributing.html). 

Please help complete this effort and stay true to the guidelines.
Mostly we are missing test coverage. See `/aurelia-animator-css` for an example `tests` file. It should only demonstrate compilation without errors ;)

## Thanks

Thanks to anyone helping out ;)
